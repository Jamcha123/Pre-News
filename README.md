Analy analyzes a news headline and a list of outcome and finds the most likely outcome.

Analy is a AI tool that analyzes a news headline and a list of potentional outcomes and lists them from least to most likely.

Web Search Engines it uses:

    - Google Search API

    - Brave Search API

    - Ollama Search API 

    - Perplexity Search API 

    - OpenAI Search API 

Then OpenAI compiles all the data and lists the outcomes (you inputed) from least to most likely using the search results.

Disclaimer: Analy cannot predict perfectly and should take it as a grain of salt
